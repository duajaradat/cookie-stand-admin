## Overview

One great “stack” is to use Next.js (which builds on top of React) and style with Tailwind.

Your job is to create a Cookie Stand Admin app using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and style using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

 - The spec for lab is screen shot of [Cookie Stand Admin Version 1](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-37/lab/cookie-stand-admin-version-1.png)

 - pages/Index.js should…

         - Have <Head> component with page title set to Cookie Stand Admin
         - Have a header component that matches spec.
         - Have a <main> component containing <form> and a placeholder component showing JSON string of last created Cookie Stand.
         - Have a <footer> component that matches spec.  

 - Style app using TailwindCSS utility classes.

## Implementation Notes

 - npx create-next-app –example with-tailwindcss cookie-stand-admin
         
 - strip out unused files

        - Won’t break if they get left in, but a good practice to remove stuff you’re not using.

 - Pro tip: Tailwind CSS Extension Pack

## User Acceptance Tests

 - No testing required.
